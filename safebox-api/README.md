# Unsafebox API Challenge

Security-ish is a security company which main business is taking care of
houses and people belongings.

Their first product launch is this API, a (unsafe) remote-control safebox that they sell to their customer in order to
keep their belongings as safe as possible, providing them the ability to control their safebox remotely through a mobile
app.

## Current Status

The CEO of Security-ish, who does not have technical background, has paid for an external consultant to develop the
first version of the product.

These guys have created an [API definition](./open-api.spec.yaml) (with OpenAPI) with the main endpoints of it, but once
they start coding they broke their collaboration. So the CEO is looking for someone who could help her to create the
first version of that API.

The CEO is not techie, and he spent a lot of money to make this product a reality. So, despite the low level of security
described on the definition of the API, he wants to go ahead and launch this first version. So, let's give a try!

## Requirements

The CEO has sent us the following business requirements:

* Each safebox will have a **unique** id, a **non-empty name** and a **password**.
* The safebox have to allow the following actions
    * Add content to the safebox (based on the generated id)
    * Get the content of the safebox (based on the generated id)
    * All endpoints have to be secured with Basic Auth (using name & password)
* You should ensure that the password is strong enough

## What are we looking for?

* **A well-designed solution and architecture.** Avoid duplication, extract re-usable code
  where makes sense. We want to see that you can create an easy-to-maintain codebase.
* **Test as much as you can.** One of the main pain points of maintaining other's code
  comes when it does not have tests. So try to create tests covering, at least, the main classes.
* **Document your decisions**. The CEO has a non-tech background so try to explain your decisions,
  as well as any other technical requirement (how to run the API, external dependencies, etc ...)

## How to submit your solution

* Push your code to the `devel` branch - we encourage you to commit regularly to show your thinking process was.
* **Create a new Pull Request** to `main` branch & **merge it**.

Once merged you **won't be able to change or add** anything to your solution, so double-check that everything is as
you expected!

Remember that **there is no countdown**, so take your time and implement a solution that you are proud!
